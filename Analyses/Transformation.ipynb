You may want to update the value or insert a new column for the converted one.  In either case, you may want to set the _inplace_ parameter to _True_ if the \"changes\" are meant to be reflected in the same DataFrame (you need to consider whether an _insert_ or _append_ statement is needed) and not assisigned to a different one,"

    "2.  Replacement. You might need to substitute certain value(s) for something else (e.g. a different value with similar representation or a dictionary-based \"substitution\" - a character for another character(s); some kind of modication - trucation, rounding, or flooring; dealing with a special case such as an escape character, empty string, or null value - _NaN_ for numbers. I learned of _One-Hot Encoding_ (that is the \"tranformation\" of categrical values into biary vectors - to be discussed later on) in my _Machine Learning_ modules but I see no reason why statistical \"functions\" can't also make use of it (or generalise it to have any ordinal values and not purely just 1 or 0 like a _Lookup table_ in _Excel_)."

Moreover you can \"filter-out\" \"spurious\" data such as duplicate rows or those with \"blanK\" or does containg \"null\" \"cells\".
